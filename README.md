## 🧠 What is PixFi?

PixFi is a donation-based pixel canvas powered by smart contracts.  
Each $1 unlocks a pixel. When the goal is reached, the final image is revealed and minted as an NFT.

Built for visual fundraising, gamified giving, and Web3-powered trust.

---

## 🔐 Powered by Polkadot

We built PixFi on the **Polkadot Hub** for scalable, secure onchain infrastructure.

| Feature | Implementation |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Escrow** | Ink! smart contracts hold all donations until the goal is hit |
| **Refunds** | Automatic refund logic if campaign fails |
| **NFT Minting** | Once revealed, NFT is distributed to all donor addresses |
| **Wallet Auth** | Connect via Polkadot.js to place pixels securely |
| **Onchain Logs** | Every pixel placement is tracked on-chain for full transparency |

## 🚀 Launch Track Eligibility

PixFi began as a prototype to reimagine how people donate online. At Consensus, we evolved it into a user-focused MVP deployed on the Polkadot Hub testnet. We integrated escrow-based Ink! smart contracts, Polkadot.js wallet interactions, and a gamified canvas experience.

This version of PixFi represents a functional product foundation — now ready to onboard real campaigns and communities.

## 📈 Post-Hackathon Roadmap

1. **Expand Donation Mechanics**  
   - Add recurring donations  
   - Enable card-to-crypto top-ups (Stripe → crypto)

2. **User Engagement + Retention**  
   - Launch Pixel Battles (team-based canvases)  
   - Introduce rare pixel drops and profile badges  
   - Add “Match My Pixels” referral flow

3. **Go Live with Real Campaigns**  
   - Partner with open-source projects, charity DAOs, climate campaigns  
   - Deploy NFT reward + merch minting for selected donors  
   - Capture user feedback via on-chain analytics + feedback prompts

4. **Introduce DAO Voting**  
   - Allow communities to propose and vote on new image canvases

---

## 📣 User Acquisition Plan

- **Target Audiences**:  
  - Web3 donors, NFT communities, mutual aid DAOs, cause-based brands

- **Channels**:  
  - Social pixel reveal campaigns  
  - Leaderboards & rare pixel reward sharing  
  - Integration into donation platforms & Discord hubs

- **Incentives**:  
  - NFT-based badges for first donors  
  - “Top 5% Supporter” ranks  
  - Matching campaigns with influencers or DAOs

---

## 📁 Prior Work / Foundation

While this MVP was built during the hackathon, our team built upon:

- Pre-hackathon UI wireframes & component sketches  
- Prior experimentation with NFT minting and wallet flows  
- Experience building smart contracts in Solidity and transitioning to Ink!

You can view our GitHub commit history, progressive UI iterations, and smart contract deployment logs as proof of development maturity and readiness for launch.
